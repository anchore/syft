# Syft testutils package

These are test functions that are useful for testing Syft and downstream of Syft. There are no API guarantees
for these functions -- they may change at any time. Breaking changes to these functions may occur without
necessarily bumping the major version of Syft or noting the breakage in the release notes.

These functions are only for testing purposes and should not be used in production code.
