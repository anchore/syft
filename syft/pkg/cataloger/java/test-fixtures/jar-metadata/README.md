# Jar-Metadata test fixtures

Each directory is the name of a jar to be created (simply a zip) based on the contents of the directory.
This prevents us from having to create real jars by hand or keep binaries in the repo. This also means we dont need the
entire jar, only the necessary metadata for testing.
