Description: A consistent, simple and easy to use set of wrappers around
    the fantastic 'stringi' package. All function and argument names (and
    positions) are consistent, all functions deal with "NA"'s and zero
    length vectors in the same way, and the output from one function is
    easy to feed into the input of another.
