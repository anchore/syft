Description: Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
        language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

        Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has
        modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
        dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and
        libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
        Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python
        is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a
        programmable interface.

        The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,
        on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't
        listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for
        it. Ask around on comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python
        yourself.
