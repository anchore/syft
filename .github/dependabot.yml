# Dependabot configuration
#
# Grouping behavior (see inline comments for details):
#   - Minor + patch updates: grouped into a single PR per ecosystem
#   - Major version bumps: individual PR per dependency
#   - Security updates: individual PR per dependency
#
# Note: "patch" refers to semver version bumps (1.2.3 -> 1.2.4), not security fixes.
# Security updates are identified separately via GitHub's Advisory Database and
# can be any version bump (patch, minor, or major) that fixes a known CVE.
