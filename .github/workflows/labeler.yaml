  # IMPORTANT! This workflow is triggered by the `pull_request_target` event
  # which means that forked PRs will run with access secrets from the repo
  # it's forked from (the "target" repo).
  #
  # For this reason we only NEVER checkout the code from the pull request
  # (e.g. "ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}") to prevent
  # accidentally running potentially untrusted code.
  #
  # By default the checkout will be:
  #   - GITHUB_SHA: Last commit on the PR base branch
  #   - GITHUB_REF: PR base branch
  #
  # ...unlike a typical PR where:
  #   - GITHUB_SHA: Last merge commit on the GITHUB_REF branch
  #   - GITHUB_REF: PR merge branch refs/pull/:prNumber/merge
