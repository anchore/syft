- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

- [ ] Documentation (updates the documentation)
- [ ] Chore (improve the developer experience, fix a test flake, etc, without changing the visible behavior of Syft)
- [ ] Performance (make Syft run faster or use less memory, without changing visible behavior much)

# Checklist:

- [ ] I have tested my code in common scenarios and confirmed there are no regressions
