# CycloneDX Schemas

`syft` generates a CycloneDX BOm output. We want to be able to validate the CycloneDX schemas
(and dependent schemas) against generated syft output. The best way to do this is with `xmllint`,
however, this tool does not know how to deal with references from HTTP, only the local filesystem.
For this reason we've included a copy of all schemas needed to validate `syft` output, modified
to reference local copies of dependent schemas.
