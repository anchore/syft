# we should strive to not commit blobs to the repo and strive to keep the build process of how blobs are acquired in-repo.
# this blob is generated from syft/syft/catalogers/java/test-fixtures/java-builds , however, preserving the build process
# twice in the repo seems redundant (even via symlink). Given that the fixture is a few kilobytes in size, the build process is already
# captured, and integration tests should only be testing if jars can be discovered (not necessarily depth in java detection
# functionality), committing it seems like an acceptable exception.
